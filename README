itunes-rails is a web server wrapper for and interface to your local iTunes
application. 

WARNING: iTunesRails overwrite the (hopefully little-used) "comment" field of
your iTunes tracks to record the last person who queued that track. So if you
have any comments on tracks you want to preserve, please do not queue those
tracks on iTunesRails, or don't use iTunesRails.

Once the code is checked out from the code repository, type

cd itunes-rails

and then

mongrel_rails start

This should start itunes-rails. Open a web browser to the URL

http://localhost:3000 

You should see the itunes-rails web interface.

If the Terminal complains that you need a newer version of Ruby on Rails, type

sudo gem install rails -y

and enter your OS X user account password (assuming you're an administrator on
this Mac). That should bring you up to date. Then repeat the instructions
starting above at "mongrel_rails start".

To let other people on your local network access the same interface, make sure
you turn on Web Sharing in the Sharing System Preferences panel. People should
be able to hit itunes-rails using your computer's website address as indicated
by the Sharing Preferences panel, with ":3000" appended to it.

iTunesRails is still evolving. To get the latest features and bugfixes, cd into
your itunes-rails directory and type

svn up

This should update the code. Then stop the mongrel_rails process (with
Control-C) if you haven't already and restart it with "mongrel_rails start".

To let other people easily drop in audio files and have them automatically added
to the iTunes library running behind iTunesRails, you can set up a shared folder
with the appropriate Automator folder actions. A more detailed guide on this is
forthcoming.

Feel free to report any problems or feature suggestions via the Issues tab
above.

Enjoy music, enjoy life.
