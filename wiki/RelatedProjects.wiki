  * Rubedo is a radio app, written in Ruby and Camping, that streams over Icecast with a web admin frontend. It’s designed for offices, maybe IRC rooms, any kind of community. Tell it a directory full of music to sit on top of, and it will feed them to your Icecast server. Searching and queueing up songs is easy, and there’s no concept of users or security. Mock your friends and coworkers for their terrible music, and freely remove their choices from the queue. Technically speaking, it’s a Ruby source client for Icecast, with a web frontend that runs on Camping. You’ll need to install the Icecast Server, SQLite, libshout, and a few Ruby gems. Rubedo is currently only recommended to run on Linux, but anybody can connect and listen to it.
